									<h2>Overview of the Project</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>Former president Rodrigo Duterte's infamous <b>War on Drugs</b> is a source of
								great controversy, and as a result, the strong subject of internet traffic. However,
								this traffic is not evenly distributed: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2016-01-01%202022-12-31&geo=PH&q=war%20on%20drugs&hl=en" target="_blank"><b>Google Trends</b></a>
								data shows that Philippine search queries involving the keywords <i>"war on drugs"</i> peaked
								around the middle of 2017—around the time of 
								<a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/specials/content/24/the-kian-delos-santos-case-a-timeline/" target="_blank"><b>Kian delos Santos's death.</b></a></p>

								droga, meth"</i> ), and war-on-drugs-specific keywords such as <i>"tokhang".</i> As this batch
								is far too large (approximately 110,000 tweets large), a random sample of the batch was
								scoured by-hand for war-on-drugs-related mis/disinformation.

								At the end of the process, <b>155 mis/disinformation tweets were acquired.</b>

						<!-- Exploration -->
						<section id="exploration" class="main special">
							<header class="major">
								<h2>Exploring the Data</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<h2><b>Data Preprocessing</b></h2>
								<h3><i>How did we ensure that there were no missing values?</i></h3>
								<p class="content">
								All the relevant information taken from a <b>war on drugs mis/disinformation tweet</b>
								is acquired from data collection.
								
								This includes the <i>tweet content</i> (allowing us to review the tweet for data
								collection), <i>account handle, tweet URL</i> (as proof the tweet existed at some
								point in data collection), and <i>date posted.</i>

								The dataset was also quickly checked after data collection through Python
								to guarantee that none of the tweets have missing values for any of the
								necessary information. This can be seen in the attached Python Notebook below.
								</p>

								<h3><i>How did we handle outliers?</i></h3>
								<p class="content">
								In a <b>time-series analysis,</b> outliers are generally referred to as extremely
								high values. As our research question involves checking peaks in tweet frequency,
								it is important to keep high frequencies in our data set.

								Outliers can also exist by being outside of the time period under study (in our case,
								from 2016 to 2022), which can be checked through Python by finding the minimum and
								maximum	values of the date posted. <b>No outliers</b> were found through this step.
								</p>

								<h3><i>How did ensure format consistency?</i></h3>
								<p class="content">
								Tweets are reviewed by hand by us researchers. Aside from human review, Python
								was used to ensure string consistency.

								For example, dates were verified to be formatted as:
								<br><b><i>&lt;number&gt;&lt;number&gt;&lt;slash&gt;&lt;number&gt;&lt;number&gt;</i></b>
								
								Additionally, low level checking was also performed for dates and months
								(e.g., months should not go beyond '12'). Both Python and human review ensure
								formatting is what it needs to be.
								</p>

								<h3><i>Did we normalize/standardize/scale our data?</i></h3>
								<p>
								As this study tackles only <b>one variable</b> (time of tweet),
								there is <b>no need to normalize or scale.</b>	
								</p>

								<h3><i>How did we categorically encode our data?</i></h3>
								<p class="content">
								While this study tackles numerical data in dates, some relevant information is
								still categorial.

								For anonymity, <b>account handles were assigned a unique ID number</b> per account through
								the Pandas library, which will then be used for extraneous analysis.
								
								Each <b>individual tweet is also assigned a unique ID</b> during collection for anonymous
								reference during analysis. 
								</p>

								<h3><i>How did we perform interpolation on our data?</i></h3>
								<p class="content">
								When our dataset was much smaller, it initially seemed like we would need to perform
								interpolation. There are a few interpolation methods of note and their graphs can be
								seen below. Note that some methods (quadratic and cubic interpolation) add
								negative values in order to generate a proper smooth curve for the positive peaks.
								</p>
								<img src="images/graphs/inter_month.png" width="100%"/>
								<p class="content">
								Based on the graph above, <b>piecewise polynomial interpolation</b> seems the most promising.
								This is because it <i>does not use negative values, is not as simple and unrealistic as
								linear, and does not copy other data values despite missing endpoints.</i> This can be seen
								better in the isolated graph below.
								</p>
								<img src="images/graphs/inter_month_piecewise.png" width="75%"/>

								<h3><i>How did we perform binning on our data?</i></h3>
								<p class="content">
								We binned our data in terms of what we consider to be <i>"part of the event."</i>
								The tweets were binned as “Disinformation tweets <b>before</b> the time of Kian delos
								Santos’s death,” “Disinformation tweets <b>around the time</b> of Kian delos Santos’s death,”
								and “Disinformation tweets <b>after</b> the time of Kian delos Santos’s death.”
								</p>
								<img src="images/graphs/bin3.png" width="75%"/>

							<hr>
							<div class="content">
								<h2><b>Other Characteristics</b></h2>
								<h3><i>What are some other characteristics of the dataset?</i></h3>
								<p class="content">After preprocessing, but before feature generation, the dataset has <b>155 tweets</b> (rows)
								and <b>25 features</b> (columns), and lastly <b>21 features</b> after anonymization.<br><br>
								The 155 tweets collected come from <b>138 unique accounts.</b>
								The tweets collected range from <b>January 2016</b> to <b>October 2022.</b></p>
							</div>
							<hr>
							<div class="content">
								<h2><b>Visualization</b></h2>
								<h3><i>What plots did we use?</i></h3>
								<p class="content">
								Various <b>histograms</b> have been created from the dataset with various indices,
								such as by month, by quarter, and by year. Additionally, a bar graph and
								histogram were also created for the temporary bins discussed in the bins
								sections.
								</p>
								<img src="images/graphs/histo_year.png" width="75%"/>
								<img src="images/graphs/histo_quarter.png" width="100%"/>
								<img src="images/graphs/histo_month.png" width="100%"/>
								
								<p class="content">
								A <b>line graph</b> is useful for time-series analysis as trends between timestamps
								are easier represented. A simple line graph was created through Python (where
								points are connected through piecewise linear lines), and as needed, line graphs
								of greater complexity (for example, through interpolation, as discussed previously),
								can also be created. 
								</p>
								<img src="images/graphs/line_month.png" width="100%"/>

								<h3><i>Can we use heat maps/swarm plots/violin plots?</i></h3>
								<p>The above graphs cannot be created from our dataset as only one variable is relevant to the study, which is time posted.</p>

							<header class="major">
								<h2>Modeling the Data</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<h2><b>Statistical Modelling</b></h2>
								<p class="content">
								As we are comparing counts, the statistical test of choice is the <b>chi-square test for
								homogeneity.</b> The chi-square test can compare the count of different populations and check
								if they are homogeneous by comparing them to some expected frequency.

								In order for our data to fit the statistical test, the mis/disinformation tweets are binned
								into three: before the event (January 2016 to July 2017), during the event (August 2017 to
								October 2017), and after the event (November 2017 to December 2022), with the event being
								Kian delos Santos’s death. 

								As each bin has varying durations (the before, during, and after bins last 19, 3, and 62
								months respectively), the expected frequency to be used in the test should be scaled accordingly.
								Thus, the expected frequency is scaled as the total number of tweets (155) times the duration
								of the bin divided by the total length of the data (84 months total).
								</p>

								<table class="alt">
									<tr>
										<td><b>Null Hypothesis</b></td>
										<td>There are <i>no</i> differences between the classes of before, during, and after the event.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td><b>Alternate Hypothesis</b></td>
										<td>There <i>are</i> differences between the classes of before, during, and after the event.</td>
									</tr>
								</table>


								<p class="content">
								If the highest peak of mis/disinformation tweets is found during the event, then it is expected
								that <b>the frequency of tweets during the event is significantly different compared to before and
								after the event.</b>

								As the chi-square test only gives information regarding the differences between classes and does
								not specify which class is higher or lower, the same process as above can be applied for post-hoc
								testing for each pair in the 3 bins to glean further information.

								The statistical tests are computed through <a href="https://scipy.org/" target="_blank"><b>SciPy</b></a>.
								Note that SciPy has checks for various assumptions for the data (for example, having both the test
								frequencies and the expected frequencies be above a certain value), thus no assumptions have been
								broken for the chi-square test.
								</p>
							</div>
							<hr>
							<div class="content">
								<h2><b>Computational Modelling</b></h2>
								<p class="content">
								After calculating the number of mis/disinformation tweets per month, this can be graphed as a line
								graph spanning from January 2016 to December 2022, as seen in the <a href="#exploration">data exploration</a>
								portion above. Two methods will then be performed on this data to gain more insight about the nature of
								the data: <b>peak detection</b> and <b>change-point detection.</b>
								
								Peak detection is done using SciPy’s built-in peak detection function. This simply detects where in
								the graph there are <i>significant peaks</i> which can then be associated with an event. Change-point detection
								is done through the <b>Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm.</b> Change-points segment the time-series
								into areas where <i>each segment is a new model;</i> that is, between segments, the graph has changed significantly.
								</p>
								
								<img src="images/graphs/stats.png" width="100%"/>

								
								The above algorithms detected <b>8 peaks and 6 change-points,</b> all of which can be associated with some event below.
								These real-life events aligning with peaks in the graph (as well as also aligning with some segments
								of the Google Trends graph) help provide evidence that the model for mis/disinformation tweets is grounded
								in reality.</p>

								<h2>Results & Discussion</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p class="content">
								The <b>p-value</b> for the chi-square test between all three bins is <b>approximately 0.000008.</b> Thus, there is sufficient
								evidence to conclude that there was a difference in the frequencies of each bin. However, a pairwise chi-square
								test between the before and during bins has a p-value <b>approximately equal to 0.135,</b>  showing that there is
								insufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis that there is no difference in the classes of tweets before the
								event and during the event. In this sense, the frequency of the before bin is not significantly different from
								the event bin, therefore it <b>cannot be concluded that Kian delos Santos’s death caused the highest peak in
								mis/disinformation tweets.</b>

								This is supported by the machine learning graph, which shows while there exists a peak for Kian delos Santos’s
								death, <b>the peak for the tweets before the event (particularly due to the elections) is higher.</b>

						<!-- Conclusion -->
						<section id="conclusion" class="main special">
							<header class="major">
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>	
								<p>All in all, the testing shows that <b>the highest peak in War on Drugs mis/disinformation is not from Kian delos Santos’s death,</b> and no new evidence to support the claim that Google Trends data and Twitter mis/disinformation tweets are related has been created.</p>							
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								

								<h2><b>Possible Implications</b></h2>
								<p class="content">
								There are two main possible implications from the conclusion of this study, with regards to the correlation between Google Trends and the frequency of mis/disinformation tweets. Note that further research would need to be done to delve into either of these two working ideas.
								
								One possibility is that the relationship between Google Trends and the spread of mis/disinformation is not simply linear. It could be argued that people will spread more mis/disinformation in circumstances where there is more to gain. There might not be much to gain out of spreading mis/disinformation when someone is unjustly killed due to the war on drugs. However, there is a lot more to gain when doing the same during an election season, which could very well decide the presidency.
	
								Another possibility has more to do with how Google Trends defines topics. Recall that the Google Trends graph mentioned earlier lists “war on drugs.” There may be a spike in interest due to Kian delos Santos’ death as this issue is directly related to said war on drugs. However, the discussion including war on drugs during the election season might not be considered as interest in “war on drugs” specifically, as people are likely also discussing Duterte's other planned projects and presidency as a whole. Google Trends may classify this as interest in “President Duterte,” rather than just “war on drugs.”
